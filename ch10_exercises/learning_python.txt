In Python you can create classes that are made up of methods that perform certain
tasks. Classes can model real-world scenarios or objects in an attempt to simulate
how these scenarios or objects work
In Python you can access the Python Standard Library that stores a set of modules.
These modules vary in uses, but are a nice appendage.
In Python you can define a function to perform one very specific task. You might
find functions within a class, or maybe even a function that works in conjunction
with an already-defined class.
